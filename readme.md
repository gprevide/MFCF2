This repository contains the MATLAB (c) code that implements the _MFCF_ algorithm described in the following publications:

 - Massara, Guido Previde, and Tomaso Aste. "Learning clique forests." [arXiv:1905.02266](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02266) (2019).

The _MFCF_ algorithm, as implemented here, has been applied to problems concerning portfolio and risk management here:

 - Aste, Tomaso. "Topological regularization with information filtering networks."[arXiv:2005,04692](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04692) (2020).
 - Aste, Tomaso. "Stress testing and systemic risk measures using multivariate conditional probability." Available at SSRN: (https://ssrn.com/abstract=3575512) (2020). 

A version of the algorithm has been implemented in the R (C) programming language and is available in Dr. Alex Christensen's [NetworkToolbox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NetworkToolbox/index.html):
